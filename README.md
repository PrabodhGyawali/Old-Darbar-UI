# Old-Darbar-UI
This is Repository shows the React Client Server of the website I am currently developing, which I hope to deploy to the cloud soon.

React UI:
- Restaurant Menu
- Search Bar -> filter through array of object -> obtained through API GET request (ASP.NET MVC API Server)
- Filtering through Tags

TODO:
- Zoom into each menu and display item in depth
- Deploy locally and create QR code generator allowing restaurant to connect to webpage when in restaurant's LAN
